# FrontEnd Test Task


### Folder project - 'disk/', 
### but for consideration, I left the original folder - 'app/'.

Also, the validator noticed 2 error groups:
1. "The element button must not appear as a descendant of the a element.""
  But as I understand it, in the assignment I have to do this.
2. "Duplicate ID" in the preloader.
  I took the preloader as ready-made code, so I didnâ€™t change anything in it, since it works well.

Despite these errors, the project works well.
